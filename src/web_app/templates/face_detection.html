Spotify Music Recommender Based on Human Emotion
A machine learning-powered web application that recommends Spotify music based on detected human emotions through facial expressions and text analysis.

🎯 Project Overview
This final year project combines computer vision, natural language processing, and music information retrieval to create an intelligent music recommendation system. The application analyzes user emotions through two methods:

Facial Emotion Detection: Using computer vision to analyze facial expressions
Text Emotion Analysis: Using NLP to understand emotional content in text
Based on the detected emotions, the system recommends suitable music tracks from Spotify's vast library.

🚀 Features
Real-time Facial Emotion Detection: Upload images or use webcam for emotion analysis
Text Emotion Analysis: Analyze emotional content from user text input
Smart Music Recommendations: AI-powered recommendations based on detected emotions
Spotify Integration: Direct access to Spotify's music library and features
Interactive Web Interface: Modern, responsive web application
Emotion-Music Mapping: Intelligent mapping between emotions and musical features
Track Similarity: Find similar tracks based on audio features

bash
python src/web_app/app.py
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

🎵 How It Works
Emotion Detection Process
Facial Emotion Detection:
Uses FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) library
Detects 7 basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral
Analyzes facial landmarks and expressions
Returns confidence scores for each emotion
Text Emotion Analysis:
Combines VADER sentiment analysis and TextBlob
Uses keyword-based emotion detection
Analyzes sentiment polarity and subjectivity
Maps text emotions to musical preferences
Music Recommendation Process
Feature Extraction:
Extracts audio features from Spotify tracks
Features include: valence, energy, danceability, tempo, acousticness, etc.
Builds a comprehensive music database
Emotion-Music Mapping:
Maps detected emotions to musical characteristics
Happy → High valence, high energy, danceable
Sad → Low valence, low energy, acoustic
Angry → Low valence, high energy, intense
Calm → Medium valence, low energy, peaceful
Recommendation Algorithm:
Uses cosine similarity for track matching
Applies K-means clustering for music categorization
Considers multiple factors: emotion, user preferences, track popularity
📊 Emotion-Music Mapping
Emotion	Valence	Energy	Danceability	Tempo	Musical Style
Happy	0.8	0.7	0.8	120+ BPM	Upbeat, Pop
Sad	0.2	0.3	0.3	60-90 BPM	Ballads, Acoustic
Angry	0.1	0.9	0.6	140+ BPM	Rock, Metal
Calm	0.5	0.3	0.4	70-100 BPM	Ambient, Chill
Fear	0.2	0.4	0.2	80-110 BPM	Dark, Atmospheric
